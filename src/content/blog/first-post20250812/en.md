Hi there, and welcome to my blog 😊.  

I have always wanted a quiet corner where I can keep track of the projects I’ve worked on. When I posted things on other platforms, they were usually scattered fragments. After some time it was hard to remember what I was thinking back then. A blog moves at a slower pace, but it gives me space to explain the process and the result in full. It also works like a small archive for my work.  

What will I write about here? The main focus will be my own projects. I want to make a new visual piece every now and then, both for practice and for reflection. When I have time, I will also bring together some projects, whether they are school assignments or some tasks I’ve done on my own. Besides that, I might share short notes on tools, methods, or simply how I feel in the moment. A lot of things fade away if you do not write them down. Turning them into posts helps me sort out my thoughts. It also feels like leaving a note for myself to read later. Maybe years from now I’ll look back and see them as small steps I once took.

So this is the beginning. I do not know exactly how it will grow, but I will add to it little by little. I am already glad you are here reading this, and I hope you will come back again 🛋️. Always happy to hear any feedback or ideas 😉.
