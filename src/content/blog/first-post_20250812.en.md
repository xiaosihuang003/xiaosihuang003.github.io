Welcome! This is the first post of my multilingual data blog.  
You'll find posts about Tableau visualization, dashboard design, and analytics.

**How posts work**
- I publish in multiple languages: English, Suomi, Svenska, 粤语, and 简体中文.
- The URL uses the collection’s auto `slug`, so the filename defines the path.
- Posts may include code, screenshots, and links to live dashboards.

Thanks for reading — more coming soon!
